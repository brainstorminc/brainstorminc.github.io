Part of the problem is that Koalas are territorial, In each of their territories a koala has “home trees” and they have to visit them every once and awhile. So if a road goes through their territory, and some of their “home trees” are across the road, they have to cross the road to reach them, which increases the chance that they will get run over.</p>

             <p class="w3-margin">Our solution involves shaping eucalyptus trees into a bridge that spans the road. To create a bridge you make a frame or trellis and plant trees at the bottom on either side. Over time the trees will grow on the trellis. When they meet at the middle they will make a bridge. We contacted experts to see if this could work with eucalyptus trees. One of our experts said”


 “your idea is fantastic and I am always interested in what I call "left field" ideas around conservation - we must think "outside the box" and your team is doing exactly that.”

Our solution is cheaper, eco-friendly, looks better. Our bridges will lure the koalas on to them because the bridge is a food source. We shared our solution with arborists who told us that our solution can be achieved with Eucalyptus trees.

             <p class="w3-margin">The interaction our team discovered is a worldwide problem that deals with cars, animals, and developing towns that are pushing animals out of their habitats and into the street. We decided to focus on koalas in Australia because they are on the threatened list and we wanted to help these cute fluffy animals. Some reasons that Koalas are threatened are due to car accidents or domestic pet accidents. 70% of patients that come into Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital died or are injured because of that. When a koala gets injured it costs $7000 to heal them. To heal other animals it only costs $380-$1500. Other reasons for being threatened are diseases partly caused by stress, and koalas were also hunted for their fur between 1888 and 1927. In Queensland alone the number of koalas dropped from 25,000 to 4,000 only in the last decade.
Our solution to the problem of cars hitting Koalas is to make koala bridges that span over roads that koalas commonly make the mistake of crossing over. Koalas cross roads to find food and mates. These koala bridges will be made out of eucalyptus trees that are shaped on a trellis to make a living bridge. The will be placed in locations where the koalas are known to cross the roads - there are many studies that have been done already of crossing location. Additional eucalyptus (their food source) will be planted on either side of the bridge. This will make koalas want to climb over the bridge to get safely to the other side of the road. 
With further researching we found that Australians are already making koala bridges but how they are made is different than what we are planning on doing. The types of koala bridges that are already in use are rope bridges suspended from tall trees across roads, tunnels that go under freeways, and overpasses where trees are grown on top of tunnels so that koalas can cross over. Our solution to shape trees into a bridge, will hopefully be more compelling to koalas because they could eat while moving across. Our idea will be better because it is cheaper, more reliable, and eco-friendly that existing solutions.
