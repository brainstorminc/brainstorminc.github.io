<p>Sorry to ask you all to do one more question but not everyone took time to answer their questions today - parents can you make sure answers are added to the google document before sunday

I did quick googling and found answers to all the questions. Since this is your project and not mine and we need answers to put together the presentation can you please take a moment to answer once question each.

We have a LOT of work to get done on Sunday! 

Please do not MAKE up answers you need actual facts. Thank you

T-shirt/logo ideas/sketches - Please email photo or give sketches Ronan so he can add to website

Talked about measurable goals and updated/added to our personal goals if they had changed

Set Today's Goals:
Teach Skylar/Sophia programming and troubleshooting - hands on
Get Robot moving around the table - point to point (mission to mission)
Create modules of reusable code - less down time waiting for attachments/other items to be finished
Program 4 sections of code (3/4 done!)

Naming of Programs
Modules will be names for the two points being connected
ie., Base to Dog, Base to Feeder, Feeder to Milk

Wrote reusable/modular programs to move the robot:
Gyro Move Straight
Gyro Right/Left Turn
Line Follow 
Go to line and stop

Point to Point (Mission to Mission) Programming

Completed:
Base to Feeder
Dog to Milk
Milk to Biomimicry

Existing:
Base to Dog

Attachments:
Added arm to "Pez" attachment to dispense food
Worked on new ideas to move the robot OVER the seeing eye dog gate

Goals for Wednesday:
Test ideas for moving robot over the seeing eye dog gate
If 4th motor arrives work on the attachment for moving shark tank while headed to dog & collection of seal
Write code to activate the feeder attachment
Add a bin to collect food pieces

Program 2-3 more point to point modules

Read project research
Discuss and decide on animal/interaction/solution
Goals for project (Declan added a personal goal for more project)
Look at Logo ideas for t-shirt - vote if ready

<p>Homework:  pick and research an animal/problem to present to group.  Plan to spend about 30 minutes on researching this.

Give 5 min presentation to group next Wednesday.   Tell us :  the animal, the problem, and 1-2 possible solutions/areas we can work on

Hello Lego Team and parents -

We had a productive team meeting today and made a good start on the robot.  Next Wednesday, each team member will present his/her animal project suggestion to the team.  We also expect to have the field kit, so will start building missions!

Parents - during the season, we expect most work will be completed during our Wed and Sun team sessions.  So, usually there won't be homework assigned.  But to get the team off to a quick start, we are asking kids to so some "homework" before the first few team sessions .

Team -

As you remember, we need to do a project to compete in the tournament.  The topic is Animal Allies.  Our project should address how we can improve interactions between animals and humans.

As part of our brainstorming, each of you will present an idea next Wednesday.  We will pick one of the ideas to work on as our group project for the tournament.

Homework:  pick and research an animal/problem to present to group.  Plan to spend about 30 minutes on researching this.

Give 5 min presentation to group next Wednesday.   Tell us :  the animal, the problem, and 1-2 possible solutions/areas we can work on

Must have visuals - just one or two slides/papers with photos and key ideas, your chosen animal, etc.  ! Use Keynote,  PowerPoint,  or Paper 

If using computer file, email the file to me and Teri on Tuesday

Here is the list you gave me on Wednesday:

Ronan - fish farms
Rohan - moon bears
Declan - Harumbe
Skyler - endangered animals, maybe turtles 
Sophie - endangered animals

It's fine to change animals if you find something you are more interested in.

Jeanie and Teri</p>
